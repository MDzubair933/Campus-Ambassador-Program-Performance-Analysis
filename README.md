This project delivers a comprehensive performance analysis of our Campus Ambassador Program using Power BI, aimed at optimizing the incentive model. By modeling 50 Ambassadors and 2,000+ leads, we used DAX to track critical KPIs like CPA (Cost Per Acquisition), Conversion Rate, and ROI. The key insight, visually proven through sorted bar charts, confirms the 80/20 Rule: the top 20% of Ambassadors drive the majority of qualified leads and conversion value. This analysis justifies a strategic shift to a performance-based incentive model, ensuring that budget is allocated where the highest ROI is generated, thereby maximizing the program's overall profitability and success.
